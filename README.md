# data_analyses_bats

## Training code for working with serological and other data from infectious disease studies
<br>
This course material is part of the training material for a two-day course provided to researchers from a range of backgrounds who are beginners using R.
<br>
The course material provides an introduction to R and Rstudio (an integrated development environment for R) in an interactive manner and then contains example data-sets to practise data manipulation, graphical exploration and statistical hypothesis testing.
<br>

## Prerequisite software installation
<br>
To follow this course, you have to install R, Rstudio, and JAGS beforehand.
<br>
To install JAGS go to here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/
<br>
To install R and RStudio you can go to here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
<br>
To install RTools you can go to here: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

## To run from github
<br>
To run this code from this github repository you need to install a LaTex package
<br>
To install the LaTex package, open R and run the following code: tinytex::install_tinytex()
<br>
There is also a short script called Session 0 that can be run to make sure all the packages are installed prior to running the workshop, though how to install packages is also part of the course. This is provided only so that packages can be installed before the course in case there are internet issues that might delay the course.

## Course organization
<br>
The course material is organized in parts corresponding to the 2 days of the course. Slides contain both theory and practice session instructions. 
<br>
Session 1 - Introduction to R & R Studio, data types and data manipulation in R, and a brief introduction to plotting in base R<br>
Session 2 - Introduction to tidyverse and plotting in ggplot<br>
Session 3 - Introduction to importing and exporting your own data with more ggplot exercises<br>
Session 4 - Introduction to different types of models and when and why they are used<br>
Session 5 - Introduction to Luminex and other serology data from a 'data analyses' perspective, with an introduction to finding cut off values<br>
Session 6 - Introduction to regression using serology data<br>
Session 7 - Developing regression to introduce more covariates and spatio-temporal data<br>
Session 8 - Introduction to fitting models to data and some other things that might interest infectious disease researchers<br>

## Resources
<br>
You can find several great resources online. Ones students (and I) have found useful include resources such as https://rfun.library.duke.edu/, https://r4ds.hadley.nz/, https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/, https://epirhandbook.com/en/index.html and https://www.r-project.org/help.html 
<br>
Further links and references are also in the text.

## Additional notes
<br>
Note that in this workshop we use a mixture of simulated and real data. Some of the plots and examples are simply for illustrative and learning purposes. Further, this course can be seen as a "starter pack" just to get people going. There are experts in and course on each area of the material that is taught that are better than this for those topic areas.
