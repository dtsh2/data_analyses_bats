## Training code for working with serological and other data from infectious disease studies
<br>
This course material is part of the training material for a two-day course provided to researchers from a range of backgrounds who are beginners using R.
<br>
The course material provides an introduction to R and Rstudio (an integrated development environment for R) in an interactive manner and then contains example data-sets to practise data manipulation, graphical exploration and statistical hypothesis testing.
<br>

## Prerequisite software installation
<br>
To follow this course, you have to install R and Rstudio beforehand.

## Course organization
<br>
The course material is organized in parts corresponding to the 2 days of the course. Slides contain both theory and practice session instructions.

Session 3 - Introduction to importing and exporting your own data with more ggplot exercises<br>
Session 4 - Introduction to different types of models and when and why they are used<br>
Session 5 - Introduction to Luminex and other serology data from a 'data analyses' perspective, with an introduction to finding cut off values<br>
Session 6 - Introduction to regression using serology data<br>
Session 7 - Developing regression to introduce more covariates and spatio-temporal data<br>
Session 8 - Introduction to fitting models to data and some other things that might interest infectious disease researchers<br>

## Resources
<br>
You can find several great resources online. Ones students (and I) have found useful include resources such as https://rfun.library.duke.edu/ https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/, https://epirhandbook.com/en/index.html and https://www.r-project.org/help.html
